# Revents

I wrote this while following Neil Cumming's "Build an app with React, Redux and Firestore from scratch" course.

A web application for creating and sharing events.

Technologies used: React, Redux, Firebase (Firestore), Javascript, HTML, CSS.

I have set up a CI/CD pipeline between Github and Cloudflare Pages.  
Open <https://revents.pages.dev/> to see this project in production.

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```

This runs the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a browser.
